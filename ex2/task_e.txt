We have found two ways you could ensure that the server will only serve files within the www_path directory:

1. Resolve both www_path and full_path = strcat(www_path, req_path) to ensure that they are on the same 
format (unnecessary forward slashes are removed, ".."s and "." have been resolved, and so on). Then, 
you simply check if www_path is a prefix of full_path. If so, then the file must be within the 
www_path directory.

2. Run the server as User A, which has the permissions necessary to serve all directories (or at least 
all of the directories we could be interested in serving). After receiving the www_path, give a second 
user, B, which initially has no read permissions, permission to read the files in www_path. Then, when 
checking if the file exists, which we do using "access(..., F_OK)", fork before the call, running the 
"access(..., R_OK)" call as user B (and only as user B) by calling "setuid()" in the child process, 
and checking for R_OK, or reading permissions, instead.
